Counts of rare events: the Poisson distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Poisson distribution (from SimÃ©on Poisson, and pronounced "Pwah-sohn", is a discrete probability distribution. It is useful for describing the probability of seeing an event when several constraints are met:

* The number of events can be counted with whole numbers
* You know the mean event frequency (perhaps through observation)
* Events are independent of each other
* You can count the number of times the event occurred, but not the number of times an event did not occur.

The last point is stated very clearly in material produced by the Warring States Project:  

>This last point sums up the contrast with the Binomial situation, where the probability of each of two mutually exclusive events (p and q) is known. The Poisson Distribution, so to speak, is the Binomial Distribution Without Q. In those circumstances, and they are surprisingly common, the Poisson Distribution gives the expected frequency profile for events.
